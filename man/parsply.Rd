}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a vector as used in lapply() family of functions}

\item{fn}{the function to be run in parallel}

\item{type}{the type of parallel computation; \code{"PSOCK"} which is compatible with all operating
systems or \code{"FORK"} which is only compatible on Mac/Linux platforms
#' @param nc number of clusters to use}

\item{...}{additional inputs for the function \code{fn}.}
}
\value{
val output in a simplified form: vector or matrix
}
\description{
This function takes a function and margin and parallel computes, returning output in a simplified form.
