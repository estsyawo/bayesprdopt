Description: Originally, this package was created for normal bayesian predictive 
    distributions and integrates these into portfolio decision making. For high dimensional 
    data, one has the option of using supervised principal components for dimension reduction.
    It has been extended to tentatively host functions that I use in my work in order to enhance
    accessibility.
